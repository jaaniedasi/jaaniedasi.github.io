        <h1>Pondering on CVE-2022-2216</h1>
        <span class="date">December 20, 2023</span>
        <hr />
        <p>After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_avYi3_Lm9A">Nahamsec’s video</a>,
        I found myself pondering why the payload with two <code>@</code> signs worked. The CVE description did not answer it for me so I decided to dig
        deeper. Upon delving into the source code, I discovered that the primary issue wasn’t within the <code>parse-url</code> module but rather in the
        <code>parse-path</code> library, which was authored by the same developer.</p>
        <p>In version 4.0.4 of <code>parse-path</code>, custom code was implemented to segment the input string into various parts, each
        representing an element of the URL. The problematic code was <a href="https://github.com/IonicaBizau/parse-path/blob/4.0.4/lib/index.js#L82">here</a>:</p>
	<pre>
// user@domain
splits = output.resource.split("@");
if (splits.length === 2) {
    output.user = splits[0];
    output.resource = splits[1];
}
        </pre>
        <p>The input string is split based on the separator (<code>@</code>), and the <code>if</code> statement triggers only when there are two
        elements in the resulting array: the username/password and the domain/path, etc. While this mechanism works well for common inputs like
        <code>user@example.com</code>, <code>user:pass@example.com</code> and <code>example.com</code>, a researcher discovered that inserting two <code>@</code> signs disrupts this logic.
        From the library’s perspective, this is handled similarly to a URL without a username. Consequently, the returned host value could end up being
        something like <code>example.com@@127.0.0.1/admin</code> — a clever method for smuggling requests into private network segments (aka SSRF).</p>
        <p>An application could utilize the parser’s output in a filter/WAF to protect against Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), as illustrated in the
        <a href="https://huntr.com/bounties/505a3d39-2723-4a06-b1f7-9b2d133c92e1">proof-of-concept</a> of the CVE (<code>if(parsed.resource == '127.0.0.1')</code>). 'Cause this seems to be way easier than writing some cumbersome regex checks.</p>
        <p>When a backend server (e.g., ExpressJS) issues a request to the aforementioned SSRF bypass payload, it appears to capture everything between the
        <code>//</code> and the last <code>@</code> sign, base64 encode it, and insert it into the <code>Authorization: Basic ...</code>
        header.</p>

        <p>So throw this <code>@@</code> payload into your black box fuzzing list and keep your fingers crossed for juicy SSRF bugs!</p>
